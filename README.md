# TelraamSim

A simulation tool wrapped in a desktop application that simulates a relatively realistic runner setup 
with the possibilty for custom station placement, failure rates, baton counts, runner speeds, ...
It can directly stream all simulated detections to Telraam so the software stack can be tested without the need for a complete hardware setup.

Written using the **Godot Engine** (Mono version with C# support). 
You can [download Godot](https://godotengine.org/download) directly from their site in a standalone executable. 
Be sure to select the Mono version.
